# Next-Js by Codevolution

### What is Next.js ?

- Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications.

### React 

- React alone isn't feasible to create a fully-featured application ready for production.

- React is a library for building user interfaces.

- You need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetcing and more.

### Next.js

- It uses React for building user interfaces.

- Provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications.

- These features includes routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling and more.

- You don't need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need.

### Why learn Next.js ?

1. Routing (File based)
2. API routes
3. Rendering (SSR and CSR)
4. Data fetching (asynchronous components)
5. Styling (Built in support for TailwindCss)
6. Optimization (Image, Link tags, fonts)
7. Dev and prod build system
